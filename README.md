**WebAssembly Smart Contracts for the Cosmos SDK**

This repo provides a useful functionality to build smart contracts that are
compatible with a Cosmos SDK based runtime,
[wasmd](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd).

Compatibility:

- Contracts built with CosmWasm `v0.8.x` (unreleased) will run on wasmd `v0.8.x`
  (unreleased) (master branch)
- Contracts built with CosmWasm `v0.7.x` will run on wasmd `v0.7.x` (0.7 branch)
- Contracts built with CosmWasm `v0.6.3+` will run on wasmd `v0.6.x`

## Overview

To get that contract to interact with a system needs many moving parts. To get
oriented, here is a list of the various components of the CosmWasm ecosystem:

**Standard library:**

This code is compiled into Wasm bytecode as part of the smart contract.

- [cosmwasm-std](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/tree/master/packages/std) -
  A crate in this workspace. Provides the bindings and all imports needed to
  build a smart contract.
- [cosmwasm-storage](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/tree/master/packages/storage) -
  A crate in this workspace. This optional addition to `cosmwasm-std` includes
  convenience helpers for interacting with storage.

**Building contracts:**

- [cosmwasm-template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-template) - A
  starter-pack to get you quickly building your custom contract compatible with
  the cosmwasm system.
- [cosmwasm-examples](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-examples) - Some
  sample contracts (build with cosmwasm-template) for use and inspiration.
  Please submit your contract via PR.
- [cosmwasm-opt](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-opt) - A docker image and
  scripts to take your Rust code and produce the smallest possible Wasm output,
  deterministically. This is designed both for preparing contracts for
  deployment as well as validating that a given deployed contract is based on
  some given source code, allowing a
  [similar contract verification algorithm](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-verify-and-publish-on-etherscan-52cf25312945)
  as Etherscan.
- [serde-json-wasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/serde-json-wasm) - A custom json
  library, forked from `serde-json-core`. This provides an interface similar to
  `serde-json`, but without ay floating-point instructions (non-deterministic)
  and producing builds around 40% of the code size.

**Executing contracts:**

- [cosmwasm-vm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/tree/master/packages/vm) -
  A crate in this workspace. Uses the
  [wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer) engine to execute a given smart
  contract. Also contains code for gas metering, storing, and caching wasm
  artifacts.
- [go-cosmwasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/go-cosmwasm) - High-level go
  bindings to all the power inside `cosmwasm-vm`. Easily allows you to upload,
  instantiate and execute contracts, making use of all the optimizations and
  caching available inside `cosmwasm-vm`.
- [wasmd](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd) - A basic Cosmos SDK app to host
  WebAssembly smart contracts.

Ongoing work is currently tracked
[on this project board](https://github.com/orgs/CosmWasm/projects/1) for all of
the blockchain / contract work.

## Creating a Smart Contract

You can see some examples of contracts under the `contracts` directory, which
you can look at.

If you want to get started building you own, the simplest way is to go to the
[cosmwasm-template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-template) repository
and follow the instructions. This will give you a simple contract along with
tests, and a properly configured build environment. From there you can edit the
code to add your desired logic and publish it as an independent repo.

If you want to understand a bit more, you can read some instructions on how we
[configure a library for wasm](./Building.md)

## API entry points

WebAssembly contracts are basically black boxes. The have no default entry
points, and no access to the outside world by default. To make them useful, we
need to add a few elements.

If you haven't worked with WebAssembly before, please read an overview on
[how to create imports and exports](./EntryPoints.md) in general.

### Exports

The required exports provided by the cosmwasm smart contract are:

```rust
extern "C" fn allocate(size: usize) -> u32;
extern "C" fn deallocate(pointer: u32);

extern "C" fn init(env_ptr: u32, info_ptr: u32, msg_ptr: u32) -> u32;
extern "C" fn handle(env_ptr: u32, info_ptr: u32, msg_ptr: u32) -> u32;
extern "C" fn query(env_ptr: u32, msg_ptr: u32) -> u32;
extern "C" fn migrate(env_ptr: u32, info_ptr: u32, msg_ptr: u32) -> u32;
```

`allocate`/`deallocate` allow the host to manage data within the Wasm VM. If
you're using Rust, you can implement them by simply
[re-exporting them from cosmwasm::exports](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/v0.6.3/contracts/hackatom/src/lib.rs#L5).
`init`, `handle` and `query` must be defined by your contract.

### Imports

The imports provided to give the contract access to the environment are:

```rust
// This interface will compile into required Wasm imports.
// A complete documentation those functions is available in the VM that provides them:
// https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/0.7/lib/vm/src/instance.rs#L43
//
extern "C" {
    fn db_read(key: u32) -> u32;
    fn db_write(key: u32, value: u32);
    fn db_remove(key: u32);

    // scan creates an iterator, which can be read by consecutive next() calls
    #[cfg(feature = "iterator")]
    fn db_scan(start: u32, end: u32, order: i32) -> u32;
    #[cfg(feature = "iterator")]
    fn db_next(iterator_id: u32) -> u32;

    fn canonicalize_address(source: u32, destination: u32) -> u32;
    fn humanize_address(source: u32, destination: u32) -> u32;

    /// Executes a query on the chain (import). Not to be confused with the
    /// query export, which queries the state of the contract.
    fn query_chain(request: u32) -> u32;
}

```

(from
[imports.rs](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/0.7/src/imports.rs))

You could actually implement a WebAssembly module in any language, and as long
as you implement these functions, it will be interoperable, given the JSON data
passed around is the proper format.

Note that these `*c_void` pointers refers to a Region pointer, containing the
offset and length of some Wasm memory, to allow for safe access between the
caller and the contract:

```rust
/// Refers to some heap allocated data in Wasm.
/// A pointer to an instance of this can be returned over FFI boundaries.
///
/// This struct is crate internal since the VM defined the same type independently.
#[repr(C)]
pub struct Region {
    pub offset: u32,
    /// The number of bytes available in this region
    pub capacity: u32,
    /// The number of bytes used in this region
    pub length: u32,
}
```

(from
[memory.rs](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/master/src/memory.rs#L7-L13))

## Implementing the Smart Contract

If you followed the [instructions above](#Creating), you should have a runable
smart contract. You may notice that all of the Wasm exports are taken care of by
`lib.rs`, which should shouldn't need to modify. What you need to do is simply
look in `contract.rs` and implement `init` and `handle` functions, defining your
custom `InitMsg` and `HandleMsg` structs for parsing your custom message types
(as json):

```rust
pub fn init<S: Storage, A: Api, Q: Querier>(
    deps: &mut Deps<S, A, Q>,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InitMsg,
) -> StdResult<InitResponse> {}

pub fn handle<S: Storage, A: Api, Q: Querier>(
    deps: &mut Deps<S, A, Q>,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: HandleMsg,
) -> Result<HandleResponse, ContractError> { }

pub fn query<S: Storage, A: Api, Q: Querier>(
    deps: &Deps<S, A, Q>,
    env: Env,
    msg: QueryMsg,
) -> StdResult<Binary> { }

pub fn migrate<S: Storage, A: Api, Q: Querier>(
    deps: &mut Deps<S, A, Q>,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: HandleMsg,
) -> Result<HandleResponse, MigrateError> { }
```

The low-level `c_read` and `c_write` imports are nicely wrapped for you by a
`Storage` implementation (which can be swapped out between real Wasm code and
test code). This gives you a simple way to read and write data to a custom
sub-database that this contract can safely write as it wants. It's up to you to
determine which data you want to store here:

```rust
pub trait Storage {
    fn get(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>>;
    fn set(&mut self, key: &[u8], value: &[u8]);
}
```

## Testing the Smart Contract (rust)

For quick unit tests and useful error messages, it is often helpful to compile
the code using native build system and then test all code except for the
`extern "C"` functions (which should just be small wrappers around the real
logic).

If you have non-trivial logic in the contract, please write tests using rust's
standard tooling. If you run `cargo test`, it will compile into native code
using the `debug` profile, and you get the normal test environment you know and
love. Notably, you can add plenty of requirements to `[dev-dependencies]` in
`Cargo.toml` and they will be available for your testing joy. As long as they
are only used in `#[cfg(test)]` blocks, they will never make it into the
(release) Wasm builds and have no overhead on the production artifact.

Note that for tests, you can use the `MockStorage` implementation which gives a
generic in-memory hashtable in order to quickly test your logic. You can see a
[simple example how to write a test](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/81b6702d3994c8c34fb51c53176993b7e672860b/contracts/hackatom/src/contract.rs#L70-L88)
in our sample contract.

## Testing the Smart Contract (wasm)

You may also want to ensure the compiled contract interacts with the environment
properly. To do so, you will want to create a canonical release build of the
`<contract>.wasm` file and then write tests in with the same VM tooling we will
use in production. This is a bit more complicated but we added some tools to
help in
[cosmwasm-vm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/tree/master/packages/vm)
which can be added as a `dev-dependency`.

You will need to first compile the contract using `cargo wasm`, then load this
file in the integration tests. Take a
[look at the sample tests](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/master/contracts/hackatom/tests/integration.rs)
to see how to do this... it is often quite easy to port a unit test to an
integration test.

## Production Builds

The above build process (`cargo wasm`) works well to produce wasm output for
testing. However, it is quite large, around 1.5 MB likely, and not suitable for
posting to the blockchain. Furthermore, it is very helpful if we have
reproducible build step so others can prove the on-chain wasm code was generated
from the published rust code.

For that, we have a separate repo,
[rust-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) that provides a
[docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer/tags) for
building. For more info, look at
[rust-optimizer README](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer/blob/master/README.md#usage),
but the quickstart guide is:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.10.3
```

It will output a highly size-optimized build as `contract.wasm` in `$CODE`. With
our example contract, the size went down to 126kB (from 1.6MB from
`cargo wasm`). If we didn't use serde-json, this would be much smaller still...

## Benchmarking

You may want to compare how long the contract takes to run inside the Wasm VM
compared to in native rust code, especially for computationally intensive code,
like hashing or signature verification.

**TODO** add instructions

## Developing

The ultimate auto-updating guide to building this project is the CI
configuration in `.circleci/config.yml`.

For manually building this repo locally during development, here are a few
commands. They assume you use a stable Rust version by default and have a
nightly toolchain installed as well.

**Workspace**

```sh
cargo fmt \
  && (cd packages/std && cargo wasm-debug --features iterator && cargo test --features iterator && cargo clippy --features iterator -- -D warnings && cargo schema) \
  && (cd packages/storage && cargo build && cargo test --features iterator && cargo clippy --features iterator -- -D warnings) \
  && (cd packages/schema && cargo build && cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings) \
  && (cd packages/vm && cargo +nightly build --features iterator && cargo +nightly test --features iterator && cargo +nightly clippy --features iterator -- -D warnings)
```

**Contracts**

Step 1 (fast checks)

```sh
for contract_dir in contracts/*/; do (cd "$contract_dir" && cargo fmt && cargo check --tests && cargo wasm-debug && cargo unit-test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo schema) || break; done
```

Step 2 (slower checks)

```sh
for contract_dir in contracts/*/; do (cd "$contract_dir" && cargo wasm && cargo integration-test) || break; done
```
