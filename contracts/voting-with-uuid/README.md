# Voting

This is a simple voting contract. It creates a contract to manage token weighted polls,
where voters deposit native coins in order to vote.
Voters can withdraw their stake, but not while a poll they've participated in is still in progress.

Anyone can create a poll, and as the poll creator, only they are allowed to end/tally the poll.

This contract is mainly considered as a simple tutorial example.
