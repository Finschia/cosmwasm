# How to release.
- Please refer to the following file for the config file for release.
1. .github/changelog.yml
  - Update CHANGELOG when issuing a PR for release.
2. .github/release.yml
  - Executed when PR is merged into main.

### What we can do with this.
1. Automatically create a new version from the branch name.
2. Upload dev contracts
3. Publish

### Release process
1. Update the version using the script (`devtools/set_version.sh`).
2. Update the changelog using the script (`devtools/update_changelog.sh`).
   - the script generates and appends new logs to `CHANGELOG.md` using [git-chglog](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog).
3. Review the changelogs generated by scripts.
4. Make a release PR with a proper target branch.
  - The PR comment becomes the body of the release note. 
5. Do PR review and merge.
6. After merging it, CI will detect version changes.
  - __comparing with a previously released version using cargo command (`cargo tree -i cosmwasm-xxx`)__
7. CI will create a new version tag and publish artifacts with release notes.
