## CosmWasm message types

CosmWasm uses JSON for sending data from the host to the Wasm contract and
results out of the Wasm contract. Such JSON messages are created in the client,
typically some JavaScript-based application. There the usage of JSON feels very
natural for developers. However, JSON has significant limitations such as the
lack of a native binary type and inconsistent support for integers > 53 bit. For
this reason, the CosmWasm standard library `cosmwasm-std` ships types that
ensure good user experience in JSON. The following table shows both standard
Rust types as well as `cosmwasm_std` types and how they are encoded in JSON.

| Rust type           | JSON type[^1]                             | Example                                                                               | Note                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Also it tends to issue float instructions such that the contracts cannot be uploaded. |
